	<br>It feels so natural for you to just pick that meat. That creature is just like your pet.
	<br>You then moved into the room in which there is a table that you feel like you used to write letters on. You see these things on the table:<br>

	<br><ul><li>A well-made and elegant pen</li></ul>
	<ul><li>Letters that are half-burnt, you cannot tell the exact content</li></ul>
	<ul><li>Some envelopes that are already opened</li></ul>
	<ul><li>A portrait of an unfamiliar woman and you</li></ul>
	<ul><li>Dead roses everywhere</li></ul>
	<br>You suddenly feel headache and pain in your chest. You know this woman, and you were very close…There were things you have to do, but you can’t remember what those are exactly. But you follow your instinct to look for more hints anyway.  
	<br>Finally, you see a memo that says “Save her…(words you can’t read ), get out the forest and save her!”
