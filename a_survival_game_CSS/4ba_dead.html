	<br>You defend yourself and hurt the creature with your knife. The creature is bleeding out but it becomes more brutal because of that. You feel like you did the wrong decision, as you are not strong enough to kill it. It only irritated it. <br>
That creature is definitely not happy with what you did, and it also looks…depressed.<br>

<br>It bites your legs and you starts drinking your blood.<br>You die in pain.<br>
