	<br>You decide to go back to the front door to escape as you are not sure which way that door on the first floor will lead to.
	<br>While as you get to the front door, you see there are people wearing masks, and there are at least 20 of them. One man in the centre points a gun in you and does not hesitate to shoot you in your head.
	<br>Black blood coming out, you die.<br>
