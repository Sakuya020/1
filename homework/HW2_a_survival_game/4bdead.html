	<br>Now you walk to the second floor. You feel there is something sticky on the stairs and you see…blood. Both fresh blood and blood that’s left for a long time. <br>
Suddenly, there comes a creature that looks almost like a dog, crushing directly into you. You think that you invaded its house and it’s attacking you.<br>

<br>However, you don’t have any weapon to protect yourself. The dog-like creature bites you and you die.
