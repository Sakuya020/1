	<br>Finally, you see light coming through the trees. You arrived at the entrance of the dark forest!……It seems that you arrived.
	<br>But you are already too tired to walk any further. You want to lay down and rest. As soon as you stop just want to take several deep breath, you feel pain in your chest.
	<br>You are stabbed. You keep bleeding, but you are too shocked to say or react. You see black blood coming out from your body and someone behind you stabs you again and again.<br>
	<br>In the end, you feel like you hear him saying “The monster is dead, master”.
